httplib2
request
urllib

http request methods

method = 'OPTIONS' provide all the available access control methods
method = 'GET' is the default
method = 'HEAD' is used to get only the headers

similarty we can call post and put as well, something specific about put is it always produce the same response


Urllib is build on top of httplib2
post data need to be ecoded in urllib
it is better use the urlopen with with parameter
handling errors is important while trying to webscrape
